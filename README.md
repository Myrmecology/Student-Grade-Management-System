# Student Grade Management System

## Overview

The **Student Grade Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that allows users to manage student information, including their grades and averages. The system provides features such as adding new students, viewing the list of students along with their average grades, and sorting students based on their academic performance. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet functional tool for managing student data in a user-friendly interface, ideal for educators and administrators.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Allows users to enter a student's name and a set of grades, which are then stored in the system.
- **View Students**: Displays a list of all students in the system along with their respective average grades.
- **Sort Students by Average**: Sorts the list of students in descending order of their average grades, making it easy to identify top performers.
- **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Purpose

The system aims to:
- Demonstrate how to use **object-oriented programming** principles, such as classes and methods, in **C++**.
- Provide a simple user interface for managing student grades.
- Teach fundamental **C++** concepts like **vectors**, **loops**, and **functions**.
- Offer a starting point for building more complex student management systems.

## Requirements

- A **C++ compiler** such as **GCC** or **MinGW**.
- A **terminal** or **command prompt** for running the compiled executable.
- **VS Code** or any C++ IDE for code editing and compiling.

### Dependencies
- **C++ Standard Library**: This project utilizes the standard library for input/output operations, string manipulation, and working with vectors.

## How to Run the Program
